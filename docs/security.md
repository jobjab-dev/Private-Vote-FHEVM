# Security

Comprehensive security analysis of PrivateVote FHEVM's privacy and anti-attack measures.

## Privacy Guarantees

### Vote Confidentiality
**üîí Individual votes remain private forever**

- Votes encrypted client-side before blockchain submission
- Only encrypted tallies stored on-chain, never individual votes
- Even contract owner cannot see how users voted
- Homomorphic addition preserves encryption throughout counting

### Forward Secrecy
**üõ°Ô∏è Past votes stay private even if future keys compromised**

- Each voting session uses independent encryption
- Historical votes cannot be retroactively decrypted
- Zama's key rotation prevents long-term exposure

### Tally Privacy
**üìä Only final results revealed, never intermediate counts**

- Encrypted tallies remain hidden during voting period
- Partial results cannot be extracted mid-voting
- Only authorized decryption reveals final totals

## Access Control

### Time-based Restrictions
```solidity
modifier votingActive(uint256 pollId) {
    require(block.timestamp >= poll.startTime, "Voting not started");
    require(block.timestamp <= poll.endTime, "Voting ended");
    _;
}
```

- **Voting Windows**: Strict start/end time enforcement
- **No Early Voting**: Cannot vote before `startTime`
- **No Late Voting**: Cannot vote after `endTime`
- **Reveal Protection**: Results only revealed after voting ends

### Permission System
```solidity
// FHE Access Control Lists (ACL)
FHE.allowThis(encryptedValue);  // Grant contract access
FHE.isAllowed(encryptedValue, address(this));  // Check permissions
```

- **ACL Management**: Contract controls encrypted data access
- **Permissionless Reveal**: Anyone can trigger result decryption
- **Owner Privileges**: Limited to fee adjustment and fund withdrawal

## Anti-Attack Measures

### Double Voting Prevention
```solidity
mapping(address => bool) hasVoted;
require(!poll.hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
```

- **One Vote Per Address**: Enforced at smart contract level
- **Immutable Tracking**: Vote status permanently recorded
- **Cross-poll Independence**: Can vote on multiple different polls

### Spam Protection
```solidity
uint256 public creationFee = 0.001 ether;
require(msg.value >= creationFee, "Insufficient fee");
```

- **Creation Fee**: 0.001 ETH prevents poll spam
- **Economic Disincentive**: Makes mass poll creation expensive
- **Owner Adjustable**: Fee can be modified based on network conditions

### Sybil Resistance
- **Wallet-based Identity**: One vote per Ethereum address
- **Economic Cost**: Gas fees create natural barrier
- **No Free Voting**: All interactions require transaction fees

### Oracle Manipulation Protection
```solidity
function revealCallback(
    uint256 requestId,
    bytes memory cleartexts,
    bytes memory decryptionProof
) external {
    FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, cleartexts, decryptionProof);
    // Process decrypted results
}
```

- **Signature Verification**: KMS signatures validated on each callback
- **Request ID Matching**: Ensures responses match requests
- **Proof Validation**: Cryptographic proof of correct decryption

## Threat Model

### Considered Threats

#### 1. Vote Privacy Breach
**Risk**: Individual votes exposed
**Mitigation**: Client-side encryption + FHE operations

#### 2. Result Manipulation  
**Risk**: Fake or altered vote tallies
**Mitigation**: Cryptographic proofs + blockchain immutability

#### 3. Denial of Service
**Risk**: System unavailable during voting
**Mitigation**: Decentralized architecture + permissionless reveal

#### 4. Front-running Attacks
**Risk**: MEV bots manipulate vote ordering
**Impact**: Low (votes are encrypted, order doesn't affect privacy)

#### 5. Social Engineering
**Risk**: Users tricked into revealing votes
**Mitigation**: Technical impossibility + user education

### Known Limitations

#### 1. Coercion Resistance
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial protection
**Issue**: Users could be forced to vote certain ways
**Mitigation**: No vote receipts provided, making coercion verification difficult

#### 2. Participation Privacy
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Public information
**Issue**: It's visible that an address participated (but not how they voted)
**Impact**: Metadata analysis possible

#### 3. Timing Analysis
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible information leak
**Issue**: Vote timing might reveal patterns
**Impact**: Limited due to encrypted content

## Testnet vs Mainnet

### Current Status (Sepolia Testnet)
- **Development Use**: Not suitable for high-stakes voting
- **Limited Validators**: Smaller validator set than mainnet
- **Reset Possibility**: Testnet can be reset, losing historical data

### Mainnet Considerations
- **Increased Security**: Full Ethereum validator set
- **Higher Costs**: More expensive gas fees
- **Permanent Record**: True immutability of results

## Best Practices

### For Poll Creators
- Set appropriate voting windows (not too short/long)
- Use clear, unambiguous option wording
- Consider poll question neutrality
- Monitor gas prices before reveal

### For Voters  
- Verify poll details before voting
- Keep private keys secure
- Use official frontend only
- Don't share voting intentions publicly

### For Developers
- Always validate user inputs
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor contract for unusual activity

## Security Audits

### Internal Reviews
- **Smart Contract Logic**: Code review for common vulnerabilities
- **FHE Integration**: Verification of encryption operations
- **Access Controls**: Permission system validation

### Recommended External Audits
- **Smart Contract Security**: Full professional audit recommended
- **Cryptographic Review**: FHE implementation verification
- **Economic Analysis**: Tokenomics and incentive review

### Bug Bounty Program
*Planned for mainnet deployment*

- **Scope**: Smart contract vulnerabilities
- **Rewards**: Based on severity and impact
- **Exclusions**: Already known limitations

## Security Updates

### Monitoring
- **Event Logging**: All actions logged for analysis
- **Error Tracking**: Failed transactions monitored
- **Gas Usage**: Unusual patterns detected

### Response Plan
1. **Issue Identification**: Bug report or automated detection
2. **Impact Assessment**: Severity and affected users determined
3. **Mitigation**: Temporary measures if needed
4. **Fix Deployment**: Contract upgrade or new deployment
5. **User Communication**: Transparent notification of changes
